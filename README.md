# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Rita, a Frontend Engineer, Agile project manager and Product Owner, based in London UK.

I'm proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React, Firebase, Git, GitHub and command line. I'm passionate about product management, UX/UI design and the craft of building beautiful and accessible experiences that meet users needs.

In 2008, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Communication Science and Technology, which gave me solid foundations of user-centered design, computer science and coding.
In December 2020, I graduated from a JavaScript and React Development course with General Assembly to further deepen my programming skills, and I'm currently working as a frontend engineer.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently exploring D3.js with React and Next.js, and interested in TypeScript and GraphQL.
