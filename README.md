# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Rita, a junior frontend developer and former Agile project manager, based in London UK.

I'm proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React, Firebase, Git, GitHub and command line. I'm passionate about UI design and the craft of building beautiful and accessible experiences.

In 2008, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Science and Technology, which gave me solid foundations of user-centered design, computer science and coding.
After 10 years working in digital project management, I reignited my passion for coding. In December 2020, I graduated from a JavaScript and React Development course with General Assembly to further deepen my programming skills.

ðŸŒ± Currently focusing on exploring more React and Next.js, and interested in TypeScript and GraphQL.
