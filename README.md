# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Rita, a junior front-end developer and former Agile project manager, based in London, UK.

Iâ€™ve pivoted my career to software development, having recently completed a coding course with General Assembly to further deepen my JavaScript and React skills.

In 2008, I graduated University with a degree in Communication Sciences and Technology, and then pursued a career in digital project management. After 10 years, I missed progamming so I decided to brush up on my coding skills and started coding again. Since then I've become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub and command line.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning more React. And interested in learning TypeScript and GraphQL.
