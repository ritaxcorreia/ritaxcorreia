# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Rita, a junior frontend developer and former Agile project manager, based in London UK.

I'm proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React, Firebase integration, Git, GitHub and command line.

In 2008, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Sciences and Technology, which gave me solid foundations of user-centered design, computer science and coding. After 10 years working in digital project management, I reignited my passion for coding. In December 2020, I graduated from a JavaScript and React Development course with General Assembly to further deepen my programming skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning more React. And interested in learning TypeScript and GraphQL.
