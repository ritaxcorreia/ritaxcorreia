# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Rita, a junior frontend developer and former Agile project manager, based in London, UK.

Iâ€™ve pivoted my career to software development, having recently completed a coding course with General Assembly to further deepen my JavaScript and React skills.

In 2008, I graduated University with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Sciences and Technology, which gave me solid foundations of design, computer science and coding. After 10 years working in digital project management, I brushed up on my programming skills and started coding again. Since then I've become proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Git, GitHub and command line.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning more React. And interested in learning TypeScript and GraphQL.
