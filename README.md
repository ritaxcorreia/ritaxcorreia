# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Rita, a frontend engineer and former Agile project manager with a big focus on Product, based in London UK.

I'm proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), React, Firebase, Git, GitHub and command line. I'm passionate about product management, UX/UI design and the craft of building beautiful and accessible experiences that meet users needs.

In 2008, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Science and Technology, which gave me solid foundations of user-centered design, computer science and coding.
After 10 years working in digital project management, I reignited my passion for software engineering. In December 2020, I graduated from a JavaScript and React Development course with General Assembly to further deepen my programming skills, and I'm currently working as a frontend engineer.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently exploring D3.js with React and Next.js, and interested in TypeScript and GraphQL.
