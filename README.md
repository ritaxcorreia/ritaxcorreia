# Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Rita, Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer and former Agile project manager, specialising in front-end development.

Iâ€™m pivoting my career into software development, currently upskilling my knowledge with General Assembly to further deepen my JavaScript knowledge. In 2008, I graduated University with a degree in Communication Sciences and Technology, and then pursued a career in digital project management. 

After 10 years in project management, I decided to brush up on my coding skills and started coding again. Becoming proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Github.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and then I'll delve deeper into TypeScript and GraphQL.
